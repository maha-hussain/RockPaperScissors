# Rock Paper Scissors Web Application
This Rock Paper Scissors web application was developed using a combination of front-end technologies to create an interactive and engaging gaming experience.

## Technologies Used

**HTML (Hypertext Markup Language):**
HTML was used to structure the content and create the user interface for the game. It defined the layout, buttons, and images displayed on the web page.

**CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):**
CSS was utilised to style the web application, providing visual design elements such as fonts, colors, and layout. It helped make the game visually appealing and responsive.

**JavaScript:**
JavaScript was the core technology for implementing the game's functionality. The following JavaScript functions were created:

- `randomImg()`: Generates a random index (0, 1, or 2) and sets the background image of the changing circle to the corresponding image in the array of images (rock, paper, or scissors). This function simulates the systems's choice.

- `chooseOption()`: Compares the user's choice (the image they clicked on) with the image displayed on the changing circle, determining the winner of each round and updating the scores accordingly.

- `resetFunction()`: Resets both the player's and the system's scores to zero, allowing you to start a new game from scratch.

## How to Play

- Click on either the rock, paper, or scissors image to make your choice.
- The result of the round will be displayed on the screen, indicating whether you won, lost, or tied with the computer.
- The scores for both you and the system will be updated.
- If you wish to start a new game, click the "Reset" button to reset the scores.

Enjoy playing Rock Paper Scissors!
